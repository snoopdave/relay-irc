Relay Snapshot20010408 April 8, 2001 - Changes since Snapshot20010331
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Relay-JFC can now be started from an executable jar file.

* The RELAYHOME and RELAYSRC environment variables are now optional. 

  - If you don't set RELAYHOME and put RELAYHOME/bin in your path then you
    must run the relay.bat/relay.sh startup script from the Relay 'bin' 
    directory. This is not a bad default: most newbies will use either the 
    Zero-G installed starter or the executable jar to start Relay anyway.

  - If you don't set RELAYSRC, you'll have to run the build script from the 
    Relay directory. This is not a bad default since most developers probably
    expect to run build scripts from source directory anyway.

* Jikes is great, but typically newbies don't have it. So, Jikes is no longer 
  the default compiler for builds. If you want to uses Jikes, uncomment the 
  Jikes lines in build.xml.

* UNIX startup script no longer needs ksh, sh will do.

* Now includes Jython 2.0 instead of JPython 1.1.

* Also, includes the following bug fixes:

     Bug #412775 Actions always have null nick
     Bug #412776 JPython broken in 20010331 snapshot
