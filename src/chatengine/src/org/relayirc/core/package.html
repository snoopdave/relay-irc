<p>The org.relayirc.core package provides low level IRC connection functionality such
as opening a connection, writing commands to a connection and
closing a connection. Depends on the org.relayirc.util package and a Java 1.1 compatible subset of the Java class
libraries.&nbsp; Why Java 1.1?&nbsp; We want to be able to use
the Relay IRC core classes to write IRC applets, applets must run
within web browsers and these days the major web browsers support
only Java 1.1.</p>
