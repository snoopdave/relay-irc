<p>The org.relayirc.chatengine
provides higher level IRC classes such as Server, Channel and
User. Depends on the org.relayirc.core
and org.relayirc.util
packages as well as a Java 1.1 compatible subset of the Java
class libraries. With this package, you can work at a higher
level of abstraction. The chat engine package provides classes
that represent IRC servers, channels and users. You can choose to
listen to server-level messages or to listen to an individual
channel.&nbsp; The major players in the chat engine package are
shown and discussed below.&nbsp;</p>
